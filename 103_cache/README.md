# In memory cache

Accessible in-memory cache for storing key-value pairs.

Simple one for now that only gets and stores.

## Requirements
- [x] Store item in cache with TTL
- [x] Update item in cache with updated TTL
- [ ] Items should be hashed at rest
- [x] Get item from cache with key
- [ ] Clear items from cache
- [x] Cache eviction - for now, clear after TTL is passed
